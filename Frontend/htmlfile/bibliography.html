            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Cougar Cave! My name is Marco Tejada and I am proud to have opened up my first cafeteria right in the UH Sugarland campus. 
                I've always had a great passion for delivering products and providing exceptional service to people. 
                This dream took shape after years of working in various customer service roles, learning different facets of the culinary skills and customer satisfaction. 
                Opening the Cougar Cave here allows me to bring a homely experience directly to you.
            </p>

                My journey within the food industry began since a young age, where I always loved trying new things.  
                When I began my career at UH as a freshman back in August 2022, I noticed a lack of food spots for students on the Sugarland campus. 
                Seeing this opportunity, I decided to turn my passion into a venture that also serves the student community, where my
                aim was to provide students with a cafeteria they could visit for a quick bite while they spend the day in class or studying.
                I'm hoping to offer students comfort food that reminds them of home as well as diverse dishes that spark their culinary curiosity.

                When I'm not managing Cougar Cave, I love to work out and spend time with my friends. 
                Fitness is a way for me to maintain balance and discipline, which also translates into my work at the cafeteria. 
                I am also a huge fan of basketball, so a majority of my free time is spent either watching NBA/college hoops or heading to the rec to play with friends. 
                Basketball isn't just a hobby; it's a way to connect with others and unwind after a busy week. 
                These connections and a sense of community is what I aim to bring into the Cougar Cave, creating a space where everyone can feel welcomed and energized.
